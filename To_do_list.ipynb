        "# **A simple TO-DO list application using Python**\n",
        "## **Objective**:\n",
        " To create a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.\n",
        "## **Requirements:**\n",
        " Features such as: adding tasks, marking tasks as completed / removing marked items from the list, and displaying tasks in a list format.\n",
        "## **Use case:**\n",
        "The intended use case for this code is to serve as a simple, educational tool for managing personal tasks through a command‑line interface. Here’s a breakdown:\n",
        "### **Who Is It For?**\n",
        "**• Beginners and Learners:** This code is designed primarily for people who are new to Python. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts (loops, conditionals, list operations, and functions) in a real-world scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "**• Individuals Needing a Simple Task Manager:** It can be used by anyone who wants a quick, text‑based method to add, view, mark as done, or remove tasks from their daily to‑do list.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Context of Use:**\n",
        "**• Educational Projects:** It’s often used as a beginner project in coding courses or self‑learning environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**• Command‑Line Environment:** The code runs in a terminal or console, where the user interacts via text input and output.\n",
        "\n",
        "**• Personal Productivity:** Beyond its educational value, it can act as a basic personal productivity tool, allowing users to manage tasks without the complexity of a full‑featured application.\n",
        "\n",
        "This simple to‑do list program is a stepping stone that helps new programmers understand core Python structures while providing a practical example that they can later extend—such as adding persistence (saving to a file or database) or even a graphical user interface."
